# Exercise 1: Data Frame Practice

# Install devtools package: allows installations from GitHub
install.packages('devtools')

# Install "fueleconomy" package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("hadley/fueleconomy")

# Require/library the "fueleconomy" package
library(fueleconomy)

# You should now have access to the `vehicles` data.frame
# Use `as.data.frame()` to make it into a normal data frame
View(vehicles)
vehicles <- as.data.frame(vehicles)

# Select the different manufacturers (makes) of the cars in this data set.
makes <- vehicles$make

# Use the `unique()` function to determine how many different car manufacturers
# are represented by the data set.
length(unique(makes))

# Filter the data set for vehicles manufactured in 1997
cars.1997 <- vehicles[vehicles$year==1997,]

# Arrange the 1997 cars by highway (`hwy`) gas milage
# Hint: use the `order()` function similar to how you would use the `max()` function.
# See also: https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-sorting-a-data-frame-by-the-contents-of-a-column/
cars.1997 <- cars.1997[order(cars.1997$hwy),]

# Mutate the 1997 cars data frame to add a column `average` that has the average gas milage between
# city and highway for each car
cars.1997$average = (cars.1997$hwy+cars.1997$cty)/2

# Filter the whole vehicles data set for 2-Wheel Drive vehicles that get more than 20 miles/gallon in the city
# Save this new data frame in a variable.
two.wheel.20.mpg <- vehicles[vehicles$drive == '2-Wheel Drive' & vehicles$cty > 20,]

# Of those vehicles, what is the vehicle ID of the vehicle with the worst hwy mpg?
# Hint: filter for the worst vecle, then select its ID.
worst.hwy <- two.wheel.20.mpg$id[two.wheel.20.mpg$hwy == min(two.wheel.20.mpg$hwy)]

# Write a function that takes a `year` and a `make` as parameters,
# and returns the vehicle that gets the most hwy miles/gallon of vehicles of that make in that year
# You'll need to filter more!
MakeYearFilter <- function(make, year) {
  filtered <- vehicles[vehicles$make == make & vehicles$year == year,]
  return(filtered[filtered$hwy == max(filtered$hwy),])
}

# What was the most efficient honda model of 1995?
MakeYearFilter('Honda', 1995)
